New Morena Club
The new torpeda has been open for quite some time already, but the owner decided to change the rules - only invited vampires will enter from now on. The owner decided to strictly filter invitations and from the busy club, it became a comfy place to rest after a difficult day. Our Editorial staff gained VIP entrance, remember to buy premium service and read more about exclusive Morena Club!

Ongoing investigation
Our new Sherif started strong and we get a continuation of investigation! It seems some Tremere could be involved in some werewolves deals and messy feeding, or even disappearances. There are no specific names listed, but please be sure we will inform you straight away when we will get that list. Stay safe and remember to hunt in packs or in safe territories! In premium service we post an updated map of those territories, so remember about subscription!

AD Sector:
Are you tired of the same blood every night? Are sick of the constant need to hunt and track every territory allegiance to drink safely? Don't worry, we get your back! With our newest Box diet, you don't need to worry about any of those anymore! We offer various vials every week, and there is a special offer for Gangrel devourers. Just send your ghoul or familiar to Heleny Marusarzówny 2, and we will give you the best experience in this city!
*Any Tremere vampire or any servant of Tremere will not be served
