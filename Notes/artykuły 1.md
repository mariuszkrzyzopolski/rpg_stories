Elder's wisdom
To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. And then you have to suck their blood. It's like a whole big sucking thing
-Rasputin

If vampires ever spend less time playing theatrics and living down to their stereotypes, they might actually take over the world someday.

Development of the Great War
For 4 last weeks, we have had news about surprise attacks through European Elysiums of Camarilla and Anarchs, but now it is certain - the great Camarilla conclave in Prague and the biggest Anarch commune in Poznan was conquered by Sabat cultists. There are still fights in Bratislava, Berlin, and Vienna, but what does it mean for all of us? The future is for sure uncertain. In our extended news we will publish reports from counterattacks in Katowice and Lviv, so be sure to sign yourself in our subscription "bat" tier to receive it in time!

Are streets become unsafe even for vampires?
That's the question most of us started to ask ourselves with recent news reported by our dear Camarilla friends - one of Prince's closest helpers, Nina Derak was found in final death, with signs of fangs on her neck last night. There are rumors that we have Vampire rampaging with diablerization in our mists, but the case is still under investigation. The news comes from the local Camarilla authority, Anita Wrona, please report to her any clues or possible suspects in the case. Pay close attention to your kindred souls!

On the trail of Neptune
Continue our last investigation about the destroyed Neptune statue, we got information about the first suspects! We were able to get into the sheriff's files, and currently, they have two vampires in arrest! It seems one of the locals from Morena gets tangled in it as well, Jędrula was arrested last night. No one is really sure why someone from Camarilla would destroy such a statue, but we live in wild and weird times, don't we? The trial and public question is planned for tomorrow night, don't miss it!
