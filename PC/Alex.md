## Backstory
The sire is a woman who was turned in like her 40s, maybe early 50s, but she’s been a vampire for like a couple hundred years probably? She’s like a very classic cigarette mom, her voice is kinda deep and gravelly from all the smoking, she has dark reddish ginger hair, always has this kinda smudged black pencil on her eyes She probably turned his cause she thought my guy was cute, but he doesn’t know for sure cause she very quickly ditched him to kinda figure things out on his own after like explaining the most basic shit, with a very “you’re smart sweet cheeks you can figure it out on your own”
And then the touchstone character
Is like a friend from the mortal life
Who’s brother kicked the bucket from heroin
And my guy kinda helped him through the whole burying his brother and grieving process
So this guy would be around 45 rn
And he’s very much this
Forever young kind of soul
Like the dude is pushing 50 but behaves like they’re still in their 20s
And he’s a bike guy
He has his bike and he just kinda drifts around
Never settled
Does seasonal jobs
He has lots of crow’s feet wrinkles, def very sunbaked skin
Some pigmentation spots and lots of freckles cause the man does not know what sunscreen is
He’s tall and kinda gangly
He has a chipped front tooth
And he also probably suspects that smth is up with my guy cause they’ve known each other for like 30 years and my guy hasn’t aged the last couple decades 
But he doesn’t really care so long as he can like crash on his couch every so often and get a free meal
I’m also supposed to have a connection
Which is one skilled or useful mortal
But I feel like that’s kind of a session 0 moment cause I dunno what kind of connection our group might need
And the herd I think can be just
Regular basic people, nothing that special 
Not for a short campaign at least
